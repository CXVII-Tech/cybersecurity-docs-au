## What is SIEM?

A Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform is a type of software or appliance that collects, centralises, and analyses log data from sources within a network or system. If it is properly implemented, a SIEM platform automates the collection and centralisation of important log data from across a network that would otherwise be scattered, making it easier for a human security team to navigate.

## What is SOAR?

A Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platform detects anomalous activity on a network and automates a response. It applies predefined ‘playbooks’, which combine incident response and business continuity plans to determine automatic actions, supporting actions from incident response providers.

A SOAR platform is designed to integrate with a SIEM platform and leverage its collection, centralisation, and analysis of log data. Some SOAR platforms have inbuilt SIEMs, while others are built on top of a SIEM as a separate product. A SOAR can also be integrated with other security tools, such as firewalls, endpoint security solutions, and vulnerability scanners.

## Why implement SIEM and/or SOAR?

SIEM and/or SOAR platforms can be critical to organisations’ cyber security strategy by enabling visibility over the ICT environment and the detection of malicious activity. Implemented well, these platforms collect, centralise, and analyse important data that would otherwise be extremely complex and scattered. This helps organisations detect cyber security events and incidents to assist defenders intervene early and respond to threats.

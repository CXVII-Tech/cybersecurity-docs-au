# Modern defensible architecture

## Modern defensible architecture explained

In collaboration with our international partners, the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD)’s Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) has released a new publication series on modern defensible architecture (MDA). This series provides practical guidance to help organisations plan, invest in and implement MDA effectively.

Organisations can use this series to:

- Understand the core principles of MDA
- Align architectural design with business and security objectives
- Develop a clear roadmap for investment and implementation

## MDA focuses on

1. Layered architecture and traceability of architectural designs to business and security objectives
2. zero trust principles of “never trust, always verify”, “assume breach” and “verify explicitly”, implemented through zero trust architecture
3. secure-by-design practices that institute a security mindset within organisations when it comes to procuring or developing software products and services.

## Why you should adopt modern defensible architecture

Designing and implementing MDA takes time, resources, and investment. However, adopting MDA delivers significant long-term benefits, including:

- Improved organisational resilience against evolving cyber threats
- Continuous and secure delivery of business services
- Empowered users who can work securely from any location
- Greater visibility and assurance of compliance with security policies.

MDA provides a clear framework to plan and invest in technologies that strengthen your organisation’s cyber defences.

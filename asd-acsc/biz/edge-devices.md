# Securing edge devices

## Edge devices explained

Edge devices are critical network components that serve as security boundaries between internal enterprise networks and the internet. Edge devices perform essential functions such as:

- managing data traffic
- enforcing security policies
- enabling seamless communication across network boundaries.

Positioned at the network's periphery – often referred to as "the edge" – these devices interface between an internal, private network and a public, untrusted network like the internet.

The most common edge devices across enterprise networks include enterprise routers, firewalls and VPN concentrators. They can access other assets on the network, providing an appealing ingress point and target to malicious actors.

## Why you should secure your edge devices

Failing to secure edge devices is like leaving a door open from the internet to internal networks, which could allow malicious actors to gain unauthorised access. From there, they can access sensitive data and disrupt business operations.

Malicious actors are increasingly targeting internet-facing edge devices. Any organisations with a connection to the internet deploys at least one edge device, making it crucial to address their security.

Although edge devices can boost an organisation’s efficiency, it can be easy to overlook the security vulnerabilities that edge devices present. The more edge devices there are, the greater the potential threat surface, making it more challenging for operational staff and cyber security staff to secure.

It is important to secure these edge devices to minimise risks and ensure they don’t become a liability that could compromise the entire network. Compromised edge devices can lead to significant detriments to an organisation such as:

- data loss
- loss of intellectual property
- disruption of business operations
- financial loss
- reputational damage
- legal implications.
